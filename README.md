# Arbitrage Betting Bot

## Overview
This project is a Python-based tool that scrapes betting odds from various bookmaker websites. It aims to identify the best odds for each team playing on a given day, allowing users to quickly compare odds,
helping make more informed decisions as well as be alerted when an arbitrage betting opportunity arises. Currently, the script is designed for NBA games only.

## Features
- **Automated Scraping:** Collects odds from multiple bookmaker websites.
- **Team Odds Comparison:** Compares odds across different platforms to find the best available odds for each team.
- **Arbitrage Opportunity Calculator:** Finds arbitrage opportunities when present.

## Planned Future Features
- **Custom Alert System:** Alert users when arbitrage betting opportunities arise.
- **Works With Multiple Sports:** Functional for multiple sports to find more arbitrage opportunities. 
- **Adding More Bookies:** Add functionality for Bluebet, Bet365, TAB and more.

## Arbitrage Betting Explained

### What is Arbitrage Betting?
Arbitrage betting is a betting strategy where you place bets on all possible outcomes of an event with different bookmakers, taking advantage of differing odds to guarantee a profit regardless of the event's result.

### The Maths Explained
We can exploit the variation in odds offered by different bookmakers to ensure a profit. A bookmaker sets odds based on the expected probability of a particular outcome. Let's consider the odds offered
by Sportsbet on a NY Knicks vs Orlando Magic game on 30/12/23. The odds of 2.00 and 1.85 respectively suggest that the bookmaker believes that the Knicks have a 50% chance of winning, and that the
Magic has a 54.05% chance of winning. This is calculated by taking 1 divided by the odds offered (1/odds). 

You'll notice that the probability adds up to over 100%. This essentially means that if you bet on both outcomes, you'll lose a little bit of money each time, ensuring the bookie makes money.
However, in rare cases, you'll find odds that result in a probability that sums to under 100%, representing an arbitrage betting opportunity. Taking the same scenario, suppose I found a bookmaker who offered odds of 2.10 for the Magic to win. Summing the inverses of the odds, we get 1/2.00 + 1/2.10 = 97.62%. This represents an arbitrage opportunity (as it's below 100%) and we can place wagers proportional to the betting odds to guarantee profit.

## Disclaimer
Please gamble responsibly. I am not promoting gambling and this is just for my own personal interest and practice in Python. Also if you use this,
please ensure that the odds are the same as stated from the script because sometimes bookmakers can change the odds very quickly.
